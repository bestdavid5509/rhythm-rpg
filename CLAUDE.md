# Rhythm RPG

## Concept

A timing-based RPG battle system where circular prompts close toward a target zone and the player presses a button when each circle reaches the zone.

### Defensive (enemy attacking player)
- Each missed input deals damage to the player
- Hitting all inputs is a **perfect parry**, triggering a counter attack for bonus damage

### Absorbing an enemy move
- A perfect parry by the Absorber on any learnable move absorbs it — no kill required, no specific HP threshold
- Learnable moves are visually signaled on the enemy (highlight or color) and by the move name appearing in a distinct color

### Offensive (player using an absorbed move)
- Same timing prompts as when the enemy used the move
- The move continues as long as the player hits inputs correctly
- The move ends on the first missed input
- Total damage scales with how many inputs were hit successfully

The Absorber accumulates a library of absorbed moves over time.

## Tech Stack

- **Engine:** Godot 4
- **Language:** C#
- **Runtime:** .NET 9

## Design Decisions

### Party System

Party size is four characters for the current scope, with room to expand in the future. Each has a distinct combat role:

| Character | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **The Absorber** | Main character | Growing library of absorbed enemy moves; taunt ability baits enemies into using their learnable/signature move; versatile and strategic |
| **The Damage Dealer** | Pure offense | High-damage timing attacks; no utility |
| **The Buffer/Debuffer** | Party/enemy manipulation | Perfect parries apply buffs to the party or debuffs to enemies rather than direct damage |
| **The Healer** | Sustain | Innate abilities only — no absorption; timing accuracy determines heal strength |

Only the Absorber can learn moves.

### Absorbed Move System

- A perfect parry by the Absorber on any **learnable move** absorbs it permanently
- No enemy kill or HP condition required — absorption is purely parry-triggered
- Learnable moves are visually distinguished on the enemy (highlight/color signal) and the move name appears in a distinct color during the prompt sequence
- The Absorber's taunt baits enemies into using their learnable/signature move, giving the player control over when absorption opportunities arise

### Enemy Design

- Enemies can have multiple attacks, each with distinct prompt patterns
- Enemies can have heals and debuffs the player **cannot interfere with** — these create urgency and strategic tension
- Signature/learnable moves are a specific, marked subset of an enemy's attack pool

### Input and Damage Are Simultaneous

The button press IS the strike landing. Damage — to the player or enemy — is applied at the moment of each input resolution, not at the end of a sequence. This applies universally to both defending and attacking.

### Enemy Attacks

Enemy attacks always play their **full sequence** regardless of player input outcome. The player cannot cut a sequence short by missing. Each inward pass is an independent strike opportunity.

### Perfect Parry

A perfect parry occurs when the player registers a **Hit or Perfect on every pass** in an enemy attack sequence — no misses. A single miss at any point breaks the parry, including on intermediate passes of a Bouncing prompt.

**Effect:** Triggers an automatic 20 counter-damage after the full sequence completes. No additional input required.

### Player Attack Combos

Player attack combos continue as long as every input is hit (Hit or Perfect). **The combo ends on the first missed input.** Total damage scales with how many inputs were landed before the miss.

### Damage Model

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| Enemy attack — Hit or Perfect per pass | 0 damage to player (strike blocked) |
| Enemy attack — Miss per pass | Player takes 10 damage (unblocked strike) |
| Perfect parry (all passes hit) | Enemy takes 20 damage (automatic counter) |
| Player attack — Perfect | Enemy takes 13 damage |
| Player attack — Hit | Enemy takes 10 damage |
| Player attack — Miss | Enemy takes 5 damage, combo ends |

### Move Properties

- Moves have **elemental typing** for matchup advantages
- **Perfect execution** can trigger buffs or debuffs in addition to dealing damage
- Base attacks are timing-based with a **low floor, high ceiling** — functional on a miss, powerful on a perfect clear

### Bouncing Circle Mechanic

- A closing circle can reach the target zone and **bounce back outward**, then close again — requiring the player to time the same prompt multiple times
- Each bounce is an additional input opportunity on the same prompt
- First introduced in the opening boss Phase 2 as an escalation of the core mechanic

## Prototype Target: Opening Boss Fight

The first prototype is a two-phase opening boss fight. The boss is deliberately overpowered — it establishes a world with forces beyond the player, not a fair fight.

### Phase 1
- Difficult and urgent
- Most players are expected to lose; **losing is not a game over** — the narrative continues regardless of outcome

### Phase 2
- Triggered by surviving Phase 1
- Music escalates
- **First appearance of the bouncing circle mechanic**
- Harder-hitting attacks with longer prompt sequences

### Rewards for reaching Phase 2
- Dialogue acknowledgment from the boss
- A dropped item
- The possibility of absorbing a late-game move early (high-skill payoff)

### Design intent
The fight is **winnable but extremely difficult on a first run**. It serves as a skill benchmark and a compelling target for replays. Loss at any phase advances the story normally.

## Architectural Decisions

### TimingPrompt — Input Rules

Input is **only accepted** when `_currentRadius` is within `HitWindowSize` of `TargetRadius`. Input outside this range is completely ignored — no state change, no feedback, no miss registered. For Bouncing prompts, input is additionally restricted to inward passes only.

- After a **successful input** (Hit or Perfect): no lockout — the pass resolves immediately and the sequence continues.
- After an **auto-miss** (ring reaches `t = 1` without input): `InputLockoutDuration` (default 0.3s) is applied to block accidental inputs during the outward bounce.

There is no overshoot. The inward lerp endpoint is `TargetRadius - HitWindowSize` (inner edge of the window); the ring stops there and auto-misses via `OnPassComplete`.

### TimingPrompt — Bounce Timing

Variable bounce speed is removed. The outward pass is controlled by a single `BounceDuration` export (default 0.5s):

- The outward lerp **always** goes from `TargetRadius` to `StartRadius` — the same distance every time, regardless of where the player pressed or whether the pass auto-missed.
- `_t` advances at `dt / BounceDuration` on outward passes, so it always takes exactly `BounceDuration` seconds.
- This makes `Perfect@` timestamps on subsequent passes fully predictable and consistent.

Removed: `OvershootDistance`, `FixedReturnDuration`, `_bounceSpeedMultiplier`, `_bounceStartRadius`, `MinBounceSpeed`, `MaxBounceSpeed`.

### TimingPrompt — Multi-Circle Resolution

All active `TimingPrompt` instances register themselves in a static `List<TimingPrompt> _activePrompts` on `_Ready` and remove themselves on `_ExitTree`.

`TimingPrompt.ConfirmAll()` is a static method that calls `EvaluateInput()` on every registered prompt. BattleSystem calls this once per input event to resolve all in-window circles simultaneously. Prompts outside the window, locked out, or on outward passes are silently skipped by `EvaluateInput`'s existing guards.
